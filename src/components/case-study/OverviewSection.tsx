            <p className="text-gray-800 mb-8">As a student within de College of San Mateo district, I realized that Ca√±ada College is one of the few colleges on the Bay Area region who offers the Digital Art & Motion Graphics classes while focusing on 3D animation.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800 mb-8">After doing my research for this project, I discovered that the current Digital Art & Animation webpage does not represent what the program is really about.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 className="font-playfair text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Solution</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">Redesign a webpage that focuses on prospective students' experience while visiting the website:</p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-800 space-y-2">
              <li>Using images of other students to spark some excitement and curiosity.</li>
              <li>Using rounded figures to evoke friendliness and a sense of calm and familiarity.</li>
              <li>Incorporating all the information necessary in a fun layout with a lot of negative space, and friendly faces.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
